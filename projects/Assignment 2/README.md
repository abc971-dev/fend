## About the project
Author: Audrey B-C
This project is assignment 2 in Udacity's Front End Web Developer program.
The aim of this project is to create a landing page that tracks the section the user is viewing and identifies it in the top navigation menu. It is developed to be adaptative.

## Languages used
HTML, Javascript, CSS

## Instructions

Click on header navigation to scroll to matching section.
The matching section is identified with specific CSS styling. In the navigation menu, the active section is highlighted so that the user knows which section is active without having to be at the top of the section.
Click on different navigation links to switch
